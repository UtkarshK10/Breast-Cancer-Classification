#SVM- Suport vector machine

SVM PARAMETERS OPTIMIZATION
C parameter:Controls trade-off between classifying training points correctly and having a smooth decision boundary
* small C (loose) makes cost(penalty) of misclassification low (soft margin)
* Large C(strict) makes cost of misclassification high (hard margin), forcing the model to explain input data stricter and potentially over fit

GAMMA PARAMETER: controls how far the influence of a single training set reaches
*large gamma:-close reach (closer data points have high weight)
*small gamma:- far reach(more generalized sol)--> more generalized sol
